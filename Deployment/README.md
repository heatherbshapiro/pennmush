This folder contains optional templates for an Azure deployment. 

This uses the Docker template in the primary folder to deploy to Azure. 

You will need a Microsoft account and Azure subscription to deploy to Azure.

After deployment, you will still need to customize your world. For this see instructions in game/readme.
